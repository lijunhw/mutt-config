# README

This folder hosts the templates for my mutt configurations. I place the whole folder as `$HOME/.mutts`. 

Structure:

* rc: muttrc files, consisting of one shared rc file (common) plus separate rc files for different mail accounts
* signatures: signature files
* themes: color themes making Mutt easier to read.
