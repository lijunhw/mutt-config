### Set up folder mapping below

set spoolfile   = +INBOX  # default folder to display in Mutt after logging in
mailboxes       = +INBOX  # Define what mutt should treat as "incoming mailboxes" to check for new mail.
unset record    = +Sent   # Avoid duplicates since Gmail saves automatically sent mails to +[Gmail]/Sent
set postponed = +[Gmail]/Drafts   # Place to save postponed messages (IMAP sync'ed)


#### Further tweaks below

# If trash folder patch is enabled http://cedricduval.free.fr/mutt/patches/#trash
# set trash = +Trash

# If don't want to cache header and mail content, uncomment these two lines below
# unset header_cache
# unset message_cachedir
